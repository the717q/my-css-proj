        <h2>Why i became a web developer</h2>
        <p>
          For my own part, i have been <em>unconsistent</em> and have been
          working in several areas and countries almost all my 20's, and it came
          the time when i thought the best is to settle down and focus on a
          career so i can have more stability and grow on a specific niche. I
          choose web development because i have a background with C++ and it is
          easier for me to learn a <em>new language.</em><br /><br />
          Focusing on <strong>Programing fundamentals</strong> i started a
          course and <strong>learning Javascript</strong> by scratch. Since
          front end development involves more than Javascript, the best choice
          is to learn as i keep working on new <strong>projects</strong> that
          require multiple tasks.
